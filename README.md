This is a scraper for the NWHL that will scrape individual games and return a play by play, roster, and team files for the game
ids provided to it. As of right now it will only scrape one game at a time. Pull requests are appreciated as I'm not perfect at this and the code was written rather hastily. If you notice any errors or discrepencies in the data please don't hesitate to contact me at @matt_barlowe on twitter or email me barloweanalytics@gmail.com. Please include the game id and any files the script produces as well so I can test them.

If you are unsure how to get the game ids for the games they are listed in the url of on each game page.

For example <code>https://www.nwhl.zone/game/show/<b>18507472</b>?subseason=407749&referrer=3422133</code> the bolded part
of this url is the game id. That is what you will pass to the script prompt to scrape the game. Thanks again hopefully you enjoy!
